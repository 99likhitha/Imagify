**Text to Image Converter Project - Imagify**
This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for converting text into images.

**Project Overview**
The Text to Image Converter is a tool that allows users to input text prompts, which are then transformed into images using the Clipdrop API. This project provides users with an easy way to generate images from text descriptions in seconds.

**Key Features**
Text to Image Conversion: Input text and instantly generate an image based on the provided description.
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts.
Credit-based System: Users have a credit balance to generate images. Credit can be managed and replenished.
Payment Integration: Future integration with Razorpay for handling payments and buying additional credits.
Technologies Used
**Frontend:** React.js, JSX, CSS
**Backend: **Node.js, Express.js
**Database:** MongoDB
**Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
**Image Generation: **Clipdrop API
**Payment Gateway (Future Integration):** Razorpay/Stripe

**How It Works**
Users can register or login to the platform.
After logging in, they can generate images by typing a text prompt.
Each image generation costs a certain amount of credits, and users can buy more credits through Razorpay.
The Clipdrop API handles the conversion of text to images.
 


This project helped me improve my MERN stack fundamentals. It allowed me to work on various aspects like:
User authentication with JWT
Implementing credit-based systems
Interfacing with third-party APIs (Clipdrop API)
Working with payment gateways (Razorpay/Stripe integration is planned for future updates)
I would like to thank the Greatstack YouTube Channel for providing easy-to-follow tutorials on this project that helped me build this project step-by-step.

Future Improvements
Payment Gateway Integration: Integrating Razorpay/Stripe to buy credits.
UI/UX Improvements: Improving the overall user experience and design of the application.
Additional Features: Adding more features like image customization options.
